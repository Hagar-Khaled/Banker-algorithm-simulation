# Resource Allocation Safety Algorithm 🛡️

A simple web-based simulation tool for the **Banker's Algorithm**, used in operating systems for deadlock avoidance. This interactive project allows users to input processes, resources, allocations, and maximum demands, then determines whether the system is in a **safe state** or if a **deadlock** is detected.

## 🔍 Features

- Dynamic table generation for Allocation and Max matrices
- Example data loader for quick testing
- Safe state or deadlock detection with visual indicators
- Modal pop-up explanation when deadlock occurs
- Clean, responsive UI with instant feedback

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

## 💡 How It Works

1. Enter total number of available resources.
2. Choose the number of processes.
3. Input the Allocation and Max matrices.
4. Click **Run Algorithm** to see if the system is in a safe state or deadlock.
5. Use the **Example** button to auto-fill sample inputs.
6. **Reset** button clears the current setup.
